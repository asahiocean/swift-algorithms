### Queue

A queue is a list where you can only insert new items at the back and remove items from the front. This ensures that the first item you enqueue is also the first item you dequeue. Queue works according to the principle "first come â€“ first serve"

Why would you need this? Well, in many algorithms you want to add objects to a temporary list and pull them off this list later. Often the order in which you add and remove these objects matters.

A queue gives you a FIFO or first-in, first-out order. The element you inserted first is the first one to come out. (A similar data structure: stack is a LIFO or "last-in first-out")
